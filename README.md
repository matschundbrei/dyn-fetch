# dyn zone info

A small script to gather the following information from your dyn account:
- approximate number of monthly queries
- number of zones
- number of records

## Setup/install

You will need the [dyn module]() but a simple `pip3 install dyn` should get you sorted here.
Also you will need to create a 'dynfetch.ini' file with your account credentials for the API access. Please take a look into the provided example file.
